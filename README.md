Learning GitHub essentials
I am a twenty-two year old South African. My ancestry lies in the United Kingdom - my father's side from England and Germany, and my mother's side from Scotland. I am currently preparing for my studies which I begin next year at the University of Cape Town. I am in the process of deciding what degree I would like to start with, either a BSocSc PPE or a BSocSc Computer Science and Philosophy, hence my current exploration of Computer Science.
